//In VS Code editor's command line write 'npm init'. It will create 
//package.json file
//Now if we download in any package at the end we will attach 
//'-save'. This added command will save this package as dependency
//in package.json file

//Example: npm install express -save

//If we download project from github & want to install all 
//the package which is used in this project we will run
//=> npm install
